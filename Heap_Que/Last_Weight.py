# You are given an array of integers stones where stones[i] represents the weight of the ith stone.

# We want to run a simulation on the stones as follows:

# At each step we choose the two heaviest stones, with weight x and y and smash them togethers
# If x == y, both stones are destroyed
# If x < y, the stone of weight x is destroyed, and the stone of weight y has new weight y - x.
# Continue the simulation until there is no more than one stone remaining.

# Return the weight of the last remaining stone or return 0 if none remain.

        while len(stones)>1:
            first = heapq.heappop(stones)
            second = heapq.heappop(stones)
            if second > first:
                heapq.heappush(stones, (first-second))
            
        stones.append(0)
