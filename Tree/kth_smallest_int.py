# Given the root of a binary search tree, and an integer k, return the kth smallest value (1-indexed) in the tree.

# A binary search tree satisfies the following constraints:

# The left subtree of every node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
# The right subtree of every node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
# Both the left and right subtrees are also binary search trees.

# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right

    def kthSmallest(self, root: Optional[TreeNode], k: int) -> int:
        if not root:
